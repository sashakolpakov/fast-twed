    Compute the Time Warp Edit Distance (TWED) between two time series using dynamic programming.

    This function calculates the TWED between two numpy arrays representing time series data,
    taking into account both the magnitude differences and the temporal differences between the series.
    The calculation is accelerated using Numba's JIT compilation.

    The TWED is computed by constructing a dynamic programming matrix where each cell represents
    the minimal cost of aligning two subsequences. The cost function includes:
      - The l_p distance between consecutive points (computed via _dist_lp),
      - A penalty proportional to the absolute difference of time stamps (weighted by nu),
      - A fixed penalty (lam) for deletion operations.

    :param b: Numpy array for the second time series (expected shape: (n, ...)).
